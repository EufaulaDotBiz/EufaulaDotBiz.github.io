title: Eufaula Brewing
---

Eufaula has an up-and-coming [homebrew club](https://instagram.com/breufaula), but it only provides a tiny fraction of the beer consumed in town.

Local beer consumption probably looks something like this:

- 🍺 Brewed in Eufaula
- 🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺 Brewed in Alabama
- 🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺 Brewed in Colorado or Missouri or something

How can we work to produce more local beer? What can we do to make the chart look more like this?

- 🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺 Brewed in Eufaula
- 🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺 Brewed in Alabama
- 🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺 Brewed in Colorado or Missouri or something

Here are a few possibilities:

- Host events to bring homebrewers together and teach skills to new brewers
- Facilitate serving of local brews at local events
- Open a brew shop, or a brewery
- Form a consumer co-op with a nearby brewery. ([Here](https://fairstate.coop/) is an example)
