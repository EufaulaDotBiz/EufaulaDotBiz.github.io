title: Eufaula Bike Shop
---

Eufaula is a great place to ride a bike. And more bikes means fewer cars, and less pollution.

A local bike shop could sell and repair bikes for residents, and rent bikes for visitors to explore the Yoholo Micco Trail.

It would create a few jobs, and help you get back on the bike that's gathering dust in your garage.

If you'd like to see it happen, please [get in touch with Brian](https://briandavidhall.com/contact/).
