**Update 2022-11-28:** _Word on the street is Graffiti's under contract and will be reopened as a pizza place! We love to see it. The content below is now irrelevant :)_

Eufaula needs a local pizza place. (No offense to Domino's - there's room for everybody.)

Let's reopen the [pizza shop formerly known as Graffiti's](https://goo.gl/maps/kuVgt1BbciZ1gX2N9) and turn it into a cooperatively owned and operated restaurant.

(If the above sentence sounds like gibberish, check out an [example](https://cheeseboardcollective.coop/pizza/) of a pizzeria that's owned by its workers.)
