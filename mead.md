title: Eufaula Mead Co-op
---

Everyone¹﹐² should make mead³. It's simple, and delicious, and a good learning experience for all ages.

If you've never tried brewing it, we'll come to your house with all the equipment you need (it's not much) and help you start your first batch.

It'll only take about an hour. (Really!)

But we should meet first. Please reach out to [Brian](https://briandavidhall.com/contact/). We'll meet for a coffee or beer downtown and talk through mead-making, so you can decide if you're into it.

## What's it cost?

Right now, it's free. If enough people are interested, we'll become a proper legal entity and probably charge $10/year for membership, plus ask for the cost of equipment and supplies. 

(If you want to help, you can provide your own honey. But seriously, don't worry about it, let's just make some mead.)
