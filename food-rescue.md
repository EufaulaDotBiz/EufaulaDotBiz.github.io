title: Eufaula Food Rescue
---

Like everywhere else in the United States, Eufaula throws away lots of perfectly edible food. The USDA estimates that around [30% of our food ends up in the trash](https://www.usda.gov/foodlossandwaste/why).

Meanwhile, about [20% of Alabama residents are hungry](https://www.alabamapublichealth.gov/npa/food-access.html).

If we can start connecting the businesses that throw away food with distribution centers that feed people, we can reduce waste and hunger.
