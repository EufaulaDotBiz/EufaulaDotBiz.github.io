Interested in getting your kitchen scraps picked up, delivered to a local farm, and turned into compost to grow more food - instead of [sitting in a landfill belching methane into the air](https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2022/01/24/food-waste-and-its-links-greenhouse-gases-and-climate-change)?

Or would you like to help with the pickup, delivery, composting or any other part of the operation?

Please [get in touch with Brian](https://briandavidhall.com/contact/).
